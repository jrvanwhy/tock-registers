//! # Addresses and Buses
//!
//! tock-registers supports many different types of registers, including:
//! 1. MMIO registers
//! 2. Several types of LiteX registers (these are MMIO, but have padding within the registers that
//!    depends on the chip's configuration and the register's data type)
//! 3. x86 port IO
//!
//! tock-registers calls each of these classes a "bus", as the mechanism used to access the
//! registers is different. The mechanism in which a register is addressed depends on the bus, so
//! each register address type corresponds to the bus. In other words:
//!
//! * The *type* of the address pointer corresponds to the bus.
//! * The *value* of the address pointer corresponds to the register on that bus.
//!
//! Therefore, all real register types ("real" here means it's not a fake/mock/stub for testing)
//! have a generic argument for their address type. That address type implements the `Address`
//! trait. In addition, address types should implement [`Bus<T>`] for every type `T` that they support.
